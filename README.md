# Skydemon-Extras
[Skydemon](https://skydemon.aero) is probably the most complete navigation suite for VFR pilots in Europe. Its database contains the majority of airspace and airports available to GA pilots, but there are still some missing. Fortunately Skydemon allows us to create and share Custom Data. Some Custom Data can be downloaded from this repository and added to your Skydemon.

## Available data
### Poland
- airports missing from the official Skydemon database
### Slovakia
- airports missing from the official Skydemon database (only a few)

## How to use it
### PC
1. Download custom data files to your PC.
2. Copy the files to Documents > Skydemon > CustomData (*C:\Users\Your_name\Documents\SkyDemon\CustomData*)
3. Run Skydemon on your PC and open Custom Data creator by selecting *Setup > Custom Data > Create Custom Data* from the top menu.
4. Verify the data has been properly loaded to Skydemon (files visible in the left pane of the Custom Data creator)
5. Save Custom Data to Cloud to share it with your mobile devices by selecting *Setup > Custom Data > Save to Cloud* from the top menu.
6. Run Skydemon each of your mobile devices and load Custom Data from the Cloud by selecting *Setup (cog icon) > Cloud (top right) > Load Custom Data from Cloud*

### Mobile only
If you don't want to use the PC, you can try downloading the files directly on your mobile device and copying them to Skydemon/CustomData folder - if you can fild it on your mobile device.
